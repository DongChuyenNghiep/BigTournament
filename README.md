## Hi there, welcome to my project

# About this project
- This is just my small project.
- It updates aftermatch data in my old highschool's tournament.

# How can it update aftermatch data ?
- Riot Games: League Of Legends, Valorant, Teamfight Tactics: I use official Riot API to fetch data (You can see in May 2025)
- Arena Of Valor: I will input data manually through Insomnia

# Usage
You can download the code, especially Swiss bracket, Single Elimination or Double Elimination Bracket. 

# Note
- I am just beginner programmer so my code isn't clean.
- This project is in Vietnamese. In the future I will try to add English to the website. Stay tune !!!
